## Introduction

Mails for Symfony applications:
- `MailSenderService`, the sender every mail of an application goes through: texts beside the template, a layout, a text part that keeps its links, the recipient's locale, and no rendered mail in a queue or a log (see usage/sending);
- a development mailbox, where every mail lands instead of leaving the machine, readable by a page (symfony-mail-ds), a console command and the application's tests.
